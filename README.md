# BTTC Assets Tracker

Browser extension & Web app for tracking balances of BRC-20 & BRC-721 assets on BTTC Mainnet & Testnet.

## Problem & solution
It is very convenient to have a tool for tracking the balance of assets of your own or other wallets, especially if the blockchain for which it was created has different networks. 

This tracker allows you to track the balance of assets in all networks: **BTTC Mainnet** & **Testnet**.

## Features:
- Light / Dark theme;
- Mobile responsive app;
- Ability to create an account and access all data by logging in through any type of device:
   - PC (web application);
   - Mobile device (web application);
   - Browser extension;
- Ability to add new wallets to your address book and delete unnecessary ones;
- Ability to switch network (Mainnet or Testnet);
- View / track / untrack BRC-20 tokens on **BTTC Mainnet & Testnet**:
- Create & Mint free NFTs on both networks. We have deployed one contract in each network. Contracts:
    - Mainnet: `0x060555510a0ab989ca75af91c3aca7aa0f2dab94` [Explorer link](https://bttcscan.com/address/0x060555510a0ab989ca75af91c3aca7aa0f2dab94)
    - Testnet: `0x060555510a0ab989ca75af91c3aca7aa0f2dab94` [Explorer link](https://testnet.bttcscan.com/address/0x060555510a0ab989ca75af91c3aca7aa0f2dab94)
- View NFTs on both networks. Supported NFT collections at the moment:
    - Mainnet:
        - `BitTorrent Web3 Domains`
        - `NFTsFreeMint (mainnet)`
    - Testnet:
        - `NFTsFreeMint (testnet)`


## What's next for the project ?
- Adding logo images for more BRC-20 tokens;
